# Churned-users-prediction
The main tasks I did in this project:

1. Used Python to build a churn prediction model which helps identify churned customers. Specifically, I trained and evaluated 3 machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) that ensure selection of the best performing model for identifying users at risk of leaving.

2. Analyzed customer behavior patterns and visualized key metrics to show:
- Customer lifespans are most susceptible to churn (tenures where customers churn most frequently).
- Product categories with high churn rates.
- The correlation between churn and customer complaints.

3. Suggested strategies for improving customer retention rates based on the above calculated metrics.
